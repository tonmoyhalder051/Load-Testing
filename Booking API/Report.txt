Dear, 

I’ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in The Test World API website.

200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 3.33 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1000.
500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 8 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2500.
700 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 3500.
1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 16.7 And Total Concurrent API requested: 5000.

While executed 1000 concurrent request, found  3 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.06%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 900 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
